# About The Project
During my sophomore year of high school, we were tasked to come up with a process of recycling (I chose electronic), and then create a simulation in c# to demo all aspects of it

# How To See The Sim
Download all contents of this repository, then run sim.sln. This should prompt visual studio, click on any form and hit run. 
Also I have created a video on my YouTube channel, with a full demo of the entire program: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FJiHjdOJCu4&t=5s
